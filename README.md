# Weather App 🌦️

This is a weather application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. The project is created as part of my personal learning journey and as a practice ground for TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## 🧠 What I'm Practicing

- 📘 TypeScript: Strongly typed components and props
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling with responsive design
- 🔍 Clean code organization using functional components
